# employee-tracker

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build a company's database of employees that tracked their roles, their manager's roles, the department each emplyee worked in as well as their salaries. It helped keep track of irrelevant employee information as well as update any new or current emplyees' information/job title and salary changes.
